To store uploaded resume files in S3, update job_applicant.rb changing the :storage mechanism from
:file_system to :s3. You'll also need to create a config/amazon_s3.yml with the following yml format:

    development:
      bucket_name: appname_development
      access_key_id:
      secret_access_key:
     
    test:
      bucket_name: appname_test
      access_key_id:
      secret_access_key:
     
    production:
      bucket_name: appname
      access_key_id:
      secret_access_key:


== Credits

All credit for this app goes to the fine folks over at JobberBase who put together the slick looking interface for 
a vertical job board. See them at www.jobberbase.com
